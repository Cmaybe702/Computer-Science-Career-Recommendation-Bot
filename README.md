# Computer-Science-Career-Recommendation-Bot
AIML Bot for CS Career Discovery

This chatbot supports five career paths:
Software Developer
Database Administrator
I.T. Architect
I.T. Security Analyst
Network Administrator

To help students determine a career path that will fit their unique needs the chatbot asks a series of qualifying questions to the user. The questions are based on required skills for the career path, as defined by computerscience.org. Based on their responses the user will follow one of five preprogrammed paths. At any point in the conversation if the user does not meet the requirement they will be branched to another path where the requirement is not needed or is less important. If the user meets all requirements in the path, the bot will recommend the corresponding career and provide a link to the career page on computerscience.org. The user can visit this page to learn more about how to get started in their recommended career path.
